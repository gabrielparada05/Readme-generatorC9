## Usage
Users can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. Only answer every question, and the users will get the Readme file. Most of the questions have several validations to ensure quality and reliability. Please read the prompts carefully and answer according to them.   

## Functionalities
Email validation, license badge, and license link. 

## Tools Used
Node.js Module
Node.js Module: inquirer v8.24, and email-validator. To create a table of contents in the Readme file, I used Markdown All in One v3.5.1 VScode Extension.
